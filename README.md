# Description

This is the week one homework project for the bootcamp. Code was issued, with errors included. The errors were then corrected and commited by Jacob Garland, to be summitted for grading. Errors corrected include: id= link was missing in the index.html. Link was inserted with proper id format. CSS stylesheet also had some redundant code that needed to be consolidated, so elements with similar properties were grouped to eliminate redundancy. CSS stylesheet contains comments indicating the beginning and end of the section of code that needed downsizing.
